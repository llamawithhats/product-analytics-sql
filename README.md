# 📊 SaaS Product Analysis &mdash;  RavenStack

## 🗃️ Project Overview
This project analyzes user behavior, retention, revenue, and churn for RavenStack, a fictional AI-powered collaboration SaaS platform.

The goal is to simulate a real-world SaaS product analytics workflow, using SQL to extract actionable insights that could inform product, growth, and customer success decisions.

<summary>More on RavenStack</summary>
RavenStack is a fictional AI-powered collaboration SaaS platform designed to simulate real-world product and business analytics scenarios. <br>
The dataset consists of five relational tables representing customer accounts, subscriptions, product usage, support interactions, and churn events. It is intentionally structured to support realistic SQL analysis including funnel analysis, retention cohorts, revenue tracking, and churn drivers.
</details>

### Key focus areas:
- User activation and feature adoption
- Retention and cohort behavior
- Subscription revenue trends
- Churn patterns and drivers

## 💼 Business Context
SaaS businesses rely on recurring revenue, long-term user engagement, and low churn to remain sustainable.

Understanding when users activate, why they retain, and what leads to churn is critical for product strategy and revenue growth.

This analysis aims to approach RavenStack as if it were a real company seeking to:
- Improve trial-to-paid conversion
- Increase long-term retention
- Reduce preventable churn

## 🔍 Key Findings & Insights

## 💡 Recommendations

## 💭 My Approach
The analysis follows a *structured workflow*:
1. Data validation and sanity checks
2. Exploratory SQL queries (counts, distributions, timelines)
3. Cohort-based retention analysis
4. Feature usage comparisons between active and churned users
5. Revenue and subscription lifecycle analysis

Each section builds on insights from the previous step.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Work

While the dataset simulates real-world SaaS behavior, it has limitations:

- **Partial Insight:** Synthetic data may not capture all real user behaviors

- **Short Time Range:** Limited time horizon for long-term retention analysis

- **Data Gaps:** Not all users have complete data due to optional data entries, which could skew metrics

Future work could include:

- **Predictive churn modeling:** Predict and identify customers that are likely to churn to enable proactive retention strategies before they leave

- **Dashboarding with Business Intelligence (BI) tools:** Create interactive visual displays that aggregate and present key metrics in real-time
